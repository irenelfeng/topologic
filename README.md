##INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:

npm i
```

##RUNNING THE BUILD
1. Run `npm run build` inside the directory topologic
2. View application by opening app/index.html

Run `npm run bw` to avoid having to run `npm run build` over and over again.

Note: at the moment, `npm run bw` / `npm run watch` does not rebuild the stylus
